Look at /home/git/gitlab/log/production.log


If you see the following error, then the project is public, but the user is not part of the group

NoMethodError (undefined method `id' for nil:NilClass):
  app/controllers/public/projects_controller.rb:22:in `show'

*Solution: Add user to group (with atleast reporter permissiosn), or make project private
*Solution2: Access the project from the dashboard

#Push prompts for git@foo password
Check the following
1. Is the hostname and shortname configured correctly (gitlab.yml, /etc/hosts, ect..)
2. Is the git config --global configured
3. Does the .ssh folder have the correct permissions
4. Does the user have their ssh keys saved into gitlab?  

You will most likely need to reinstall gitlab and make sure the hostname is correct before beining.
