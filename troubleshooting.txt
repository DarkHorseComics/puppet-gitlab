Look at /home/git/gitlab/log/production.log


If you see the following error, then the project is public, but the user is not part of the group

NoMethodError (undefined method `id' for nil:NilClass):
  app/controllers/public/projects_controller.rb:22:in `show'

*Solution: Add user to group (with atleast reporter permissiosn), or make project private
*Solution2: Access the project from the dashboard
